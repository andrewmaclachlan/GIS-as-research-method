## What is spatial data?

> Spatial data is just like normal data except it has an extra "geometry column" often referred to as "geom"

![](img/geometry_col.png){fig-align="center" width="75%"}

## Spatial data

::: {.column width="49%"}
Spatial data is typically an empty shape or object:

-   Grid cells / hexagons
-   Polygons
-   Lines
-   Points (e.g. restaurants)

</br>

The magic happens when we join non spatial data to spatial data

## If someone gives you some (spatial) data, what is the first thing you might ... {.center}

e.g. here is an excel file that has data on:

-   BMI
-   steps taken per day
-   location

## Plot it!

::: {.column width="49%"}
"While we teach our students the benefits of visualization, answering the specific hypothesis-driven questions did not require plotting the data. We found that very often, the students driven by specific hypotheses skipped this simple step towards a broader exploration of the data. In fact, overall, **students without a specific hypothesis were almost five times more likely to discover the gorilla when analyzing this dataset"**

## Representing the World

::: columns
::: {.column width="49%"}
-   The earth is a 3D sphere (well, almost). It's wider than it is tall
-   In order to locate a point on the surface of a sphere, we need a set of coordinates
-   Coordinates will tell us how near to the top or bottom of the sphere we are, or how far around
-   But where do we start?

## What is a GIS

We need to separate Geographic Information / Spatial Data SCIENCE from the tools we use to carry it out:

</br>

GI / SD Science is facilitated by the information systems (technologies -- hardware, software + human interaction) we use to:

-   Store (input)
-   Manipulate / Process
-   Distribute
-   Analyse
-   Retrieve (output)
-   Data / Information

## We do GI Science on the GI Systems {.center}

## Data vs information

![](img/data_wisdom.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

## The Canada GIS

Developed by Roger Tomlinson at UCL in 1970s

![](img/canada_GIS.png){fig-align="center" width="100%"}

## ESRI

-   From 1982, ESRI cornered the GIS market in terms of data storage, tools for Query /Processing / Manipulation / Analysis and Display / Visualisation

-   The Graphical User Interface -- GUI -- allowed non-specialists to carry out GI Science for the first time

![](img/ESRI.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

## QGIS (Quantum GIS)

::: {.column width="49%"}
-   Under development since 2002
-   Free & Open Source -- everything is on github!
-   Probably best GUI GIS aside from Arc
-   Connects to PostGIS database very effectively
-   Slick maps with nice default features
-   Large library of plugins for analysis
:::

::: {.column width="49%"}

## Programming + GIS

> "Everyone does need to learn to code. It is no longer sufficient for a GI Scientists to just work with a standard GIS interface: menus, buttons and black boxes. " Brunsdon and Comber (2020)

Comparison of 4 GWR approaches all produced the same result except the method in ArcGIS from ESRI who didn't reveal the code.

## R + Pthyon

::: {.column width="49%"}
-   Data management/ storage facilitated through connection to a range of file formats (almost any you can think of)

-   Plus a huge host of software packages for reading, writing and converting data held within these files into a format R can handle

## What is wrong with this?

![](img/trump_result.jpg){fig-align="center" width="50%"}

## Issues

-   Polygon size does not equal population
-   Did all the people in each county vote for 1 party? NO.

Electoral college

-   Each state gets three votes
-   Remaining divided by population
-   BONUS to smaller states
-   1 vote in Wyoming = 193,000 people
-   1 vote in California = over 700,000 people

**Democrats got more votes, but lost**

## Problematic 

![](img/development_goals.png){fig-align="center" width="50%"}

## GIS methods let us answer the question "where" is my phenomona occuring and is it random or related to another variable {.center}

## Point / continuous data

### Questions we can ask / set

</br>

#### Points


Are these points distributed in a random way or is there some sort of pattern (uniform or clustered)?

>   * We should expect randomness but randomness conforms to known probability distributions

</br>


#### Spatially continuous observations (e.g. values of polygons)

How (dis)similar are our values assigned to geographic units across geographic space

## What patterns show

## Spatial Epidemiology: Lung Cancer

::: {.column width="49%"}

![](img/Gatrell.png){fig-align="center" width="100%"}
:::

::: {.column width="49%"}


* Similar methods that we will use today - incidences of lung cancer relative to the physical envrionment - are they clustered and where?...leads to why
* are the locations of lung cancer similar?
* Does the incinerator have any influence ?

:::

## Spatial Epidemiology: Mortality

* Similar values might suggest there is something more going on
* Some sort of spatial influence
* Note the difference between spatially continuous and point data

![](img/Lorant.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

## Quantifying Spatial Patterns

</br>

What is fixed?

</br>

::: {.column width="49%"}

### Point Pattern Analysis

* Properties are fixed (e.g. binary - present or not)
* Discrete objects - present or not, binary, yes or no.
* Examples: fly tipping, stop and search, blue plaques, pharmacies 

Properties fixed, but **space (location - x,y)** can vary
:::

::: {.column width="49%"}

### Spatial Autocorrelation

* Space (e.g. the location of the spatial units - wards, boroughs etc) is fixed
* The values of the spatial units vary
* Where the values are similar we say they exhibit Spatial Autocorrelation 

Space is fixed, but **properties (values)** can vary
:::

## Examples

* Question: Are the points clustered or are they random?

* If we identify clusters what are the socio-economic characteristics ?

![](img/pharmacies.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

## Examples

* Question: Are the values similar between certain wards?

![](img/average_GCSE.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

## Spatial modelling

> What are the factors that might lead to variation in Average GCSE point scores across the city?

::: {.column width="49%"}


![](img/GCSE_absence.png){fig-align="center" width="100%"}

* Dependent variable labelled y
* Residuals are the dots not on line 
* $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \epsilon_i$

:::

::: {.column width="49%"}
  
* $\beta_0$ is the intercept (the value of $y$ when $x = 0$ - somewhere around 370 on the graph above); 

* $\beta_1$ is sometimes referred to as the 'slope' parameter and is simply the change in the value of $y$ for a 1 unit change in the value of $x$ (the slope of the blue line) - around -40.

* $\epsilon_i$ is a random error term sums 0 - add all of the vertical differences between the blue line and all of the residuals

:::

## Spatial regression

* Here we haven't accounted for the influence of a neighbour...

* In our model the residuals (observed-predicted) should show no pattern (or autocorrleation)...in other words they should be random!


![](img/model_errors.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

## Spatial regression

* At this point we have several options

**Global - single regression models**

1. lag model - we can include the value of neighboring GCSE values in the model

2. error model - we treat the errors as a nuisance but we must account for them.

**Local model**

3. Geographically weighted regression - we do lots of local regression models and get coefficients that vary over the study area.

4. Machine Learning versions = geographically weighted random forests...

## Networks / location allocation 

Question: You are in charge of a supermarket chain and you want to open a new store

Question: You work for a delivery company and want to locate a warehouse

Question: In the event of an emergency call, where is the nearest fire station / ambulance / police car?

![](img/location_allocation.png){fig-align="center" width="55%"}

## Networks / location allocation 

Inputs:

* Street network (info on roads, speeds, turn restrictions)
  * Open Street Map (free, Volunteered Geographic Information data)
  * Ordnance Survey Master Map (UK national mapping agency)

* Demand points
  * Often where people live (e.g. houses or census data)

* Facilities 
  * The resource (e.g. fire station, hospital)
  
## Solver type...

What are you solving for?

* Minimize Impedance:  locate warehouses, because it can reduce the overall transportation costs of delivering goods to outlets

* Maximize Coverage: fire stations - must arrive to demand point within response time

* Maximize Capacitated Coverage: hospitals - serve demand without going over capacity

## Great...however...

food deserts’ where people are likely to pay a higher cost for their weekly food shopping and have to shop in more expensive small convenience stores with a limited stock of good value fresh products.

* Water points from World Bank
* Friction surface from Malaria Atlas (the cost to travel across the cell)
* 100m population data from World Pop

## Why are they large?

**Raster**

-   Landsat satellite data: 400 scenes of Earth a day, revising each location every 16 days

    -   Each scene is about 1GB
    -   We'd used Google Earth Engine - not considered here

**Vector**

-   New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) all records from Yellow and Green Cabs

    -   150GB, 1.2 billion records

-   Open Street Map

    -   1764.5GB when uncompressed

## What can we do about it?

#### Parquet files

-   We are moving from row based storage **to column based**

-   About 50x faster than a .csv

-   It groups our data.

    -   For example a row group size of 2, puts rows all the data from 1 and 2 next to each other **then** we have 3! = GROUPS or PARTITION

    -   If we have large data this means we can skip groups we don't need

## Concepts

-   You may come across **Arrow** - this is an in-memory format, **Parquet** is a storage format

 

-   In the R for Data Science book a 9BG `.csv` is queried in

    -   11 seconds for standard code
    -   0.063 seconds using a parquet file! 100x faster

## We can go faster!

<br/>

![](img/duck.jpg){fig-align="center" width="50%"}

## DuckDB

-   Database management system

-   Columnar data

-   No installation

-   Convert our Parquet file to DuckDB and back again!

```{r, eval=FALSE}
to_duckdb() 
to_arrow()
```

> Regarding performance, parquet is 717 times faster than the same query on a csv file, and duckdb is 2808 times faster.

:::

## Notes

-   All (parquet and DuckDB) make sure of `dplyr` ! `select()`, `filter()`, `groupby()` = direct integration with R

-   Currently the **support for spatial data** is very limited

-   [sfarrow](https://wcjochem.github.io/sfarrow/articles/example_sfarrow.html) - can load and query the data but can't do any analysis!

## Postgres

## PostGIS

<br/>

![](img/PostGIS_logo.png){height="300px" fig-align="center"}

## Starting

-   Despite all these tools we must start with the basics.

-   Often this is in Quantum GIS (free) or ArcMap(\$)

![](img/QGIS.png){fig-align="center" width="558"}


## Conclusion

-   It is essential to use data to inform decisions...BUT we must develop a **critical awareness** of:

    -   How the data has been created
    -   How the boundary data has been created
    -   What **the agenda** was for collecting the data

-   Almost any data can be spatial

-   We must recognize that:

    -   Data is a **snapshot / sample** of the population
    -   Analysis attempts to **model the world** - it is *never* perfect.
